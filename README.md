# LSST-Brightish
Some work for a short exposure survey with Vera C. Rubin Observatory as part of LSST to get data for bright(ish) stars.

Here, we match Gaia stars with good parallaxes (such a pi/sigma_pi > 20) with Pan-STARRS (PS1), SkyMapper DR2, and SDSS.
Stars are plotted with estimates of whether they would be saturated in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST survey
30 second exposires, and then also with proposed shorter exposures of 5s or 1s.
